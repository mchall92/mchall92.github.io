        <p>
            I am currently in my second year of a Master's degree in computer science at Northeastern University.
            </p>
        <p>
            After completion of my degree in medicine and public helath, I joined the ALIGN program at Northeastern in 2020. Since then, I have gained fundamental knowledge and technical skills in programming. 
            I am always eager to take up challenges and enjoy innovative thinking for problem-solving, which is powered by my ability to learn new skills. 
            With my previous experience, I have been trained to plan strategically and logically. 
            I believe the skills I developed in computer science, along with my clinical and public health experience, will enable me to bring different perspectives into the tech world.
        </p>

        <p>
            My current goal is to gain more real-world experience through co-ops/internships. In the future, I hope to contribute to people's health through technology.
