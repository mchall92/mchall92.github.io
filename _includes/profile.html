        <p>
            I am currently in my second year of a Master's degree in computer science at Northeastern University.
            </p>
        <p>
            After completing a degree in medicine and public health, 
            I joined the ALIGN program at Northeastern in 2020. Since then, 
            I have gained fundamental knowledge and technical skills in programming. 
            My ability to learn new skills has always prompted me to take up 
            challenges and I have enjoyed the process of innovative thinking 
            for problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe the skills I have developed in computer science, 
            my clinical and public health background, and most important 
            of all, my passion to make this a better and healthier 
            world through technology, will enable me to bring different 
            perspectives into the tech world.
        </p>

        <p>
            My current goal is to gain more real-world experience 
            from co-ops/internships. In the future, I hope to contribute 
            to people's health with the power of technology.
